# hackerrank-problems
This repository contains solutions to www.hackerrank.com problems in multiple languages. However, I no longer maintain this repository. All of my Hackerrank work is now in another repository.

# My profile
I love solving problems and I love writing code! My hackerrank id is 'ceevee87' and as of the beginning of May 2017 I was in the 78th percentile of algorithms. I have solved 50 problems on the hackerrank website.

# Languages
This repository will contain solutions to some but not all of my hackerrank problems. I currently prefer Java 8 & Python 3. So, you'll see solutions to both as I grow this repository.

It is entirey possible that some solutions will be done in one language but not another (yet).

# Validation
I will try to use JUnit testing for all my Java solutions. 

For Python I don't have an established scheme I'll be employing yet.

# Notes
HackerRank requires that all solutions be submitted as single files. This will make some of my solutions not as well organized as I would prefer. For example, in some of the graph problems I would prefer to have a separate class, in a separate file, that manages my graph model. So, in these solutions you may see some funky looking Java that I would not otherwise write.

# IDE
Java solutions will be done as Maven builds within NetBeans 8.2. 

Python solutions will done using Emacs (just for kicks!). 

The operating system is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS running on an ancient Lenovo T61.
